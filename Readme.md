# Univ2-Tri-Arb
This code still works! Just git clone the repository and use `cargo run -r`. If you want to check token fees or ensure the pairs are valid, just run `cargo run -r`, This will make a fresh db.json file with all the taxes collected and valid pairs, else use `cargo run -r load`

### Use case
For learning and reusing components such as a uni v2 token tax checker, a generalized framework for arbitrage, etc...


### This code is an absolute mess and is highly discoraged to run in prod.
### Came across this while cleaning up my computer. Instead of trashing it, thought it could help newbies starting out. glglgl!
